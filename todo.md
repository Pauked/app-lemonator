Todo list:
TODO: Add method to update last run path periodically (or after each run?).
TODO: MacOS file version checking!
TODO: Add an --edit mode that can allow individual properties to be amended. Thinking of JetBrains tools changing their base path!
TODO: Add abort to folder_search
TODO: In apps table, denote OS of app. Then use this to stop apps being opened on the wrong OS. Basically I can have one db of shortcuts for all OSes I use.
